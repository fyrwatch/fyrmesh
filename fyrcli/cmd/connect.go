	Short: "Set the connection state of the control node.",
	Long: `Set the connection state of the control node by sending the appropriate command to the it.

The command expects the 'set' flag which defaults to 'on'. The supported set phrases are given below:
- values such as 'on', 'true', 'connect' and 'yes' -> set the connection status to true.
- values such as 'off', 'false', 'disconnect' and 'no' -> set the connection status to false. 

Setting the connection state will simply flip the state of the onboard LED on the control node. 
This is useful to test whether the connection pipeline between the CLI and the control node is active, 
while also serving as a way to indicate that the CLI is currently communicating with the control node`,
